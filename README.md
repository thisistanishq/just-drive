# 🏎️ JUST DRIVE.

**Warning: May cause extreme addiction to virtual drifting.**

Forget every boring "car game" you've ever seen on the web. This is raw, unadulterated physics running straight in your browser. No installs. No waiting. **Just. Drive.**

### 🔥 THE VIBE
We dropped a high-performance EV into an infinite desert and turned gravity into a suggestion. 
- **Drift it.** Slide it. Send it. 
- **Real Physics:** You feel the weight transfer. You feel the grip loss. It’s not an animation; it’s a simulation.

### 📱 MOBILE GOD MODE
Most mobile web games feel cheap. This one feels expensive. We built a custom cockpit UI that puts console controllers to shame.
- **Stitched Leather Steering Wheel:** Auto-centers, grips like reality, looks sick.
- **Drilled Aluminum Pedals:** Gas and Brake with proper weight. Plastic is for toys.
- **Carbon Fiber Gear Console:** Tap to shift. **P** for Park, **D** to Dominate. 

### 💻 UNDER THE HOOD
- **Engine:** Three.js + Custom Physics Integration.
- **Code:** Hand-crafted, optimized JavaScript. No 50MB frameworks slowing you down. 
- **Vibe:** Unmatched.
